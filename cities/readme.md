"Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. All geographic boundaries for the 2019 population estimates are as of January 1, 2019. An ""(X)"" in the 2010 Census field indicates a locality that was formed or incorporated after the 2010 Census. Additional information on these localities can be found in the Geographic Boundary Change Notes (see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/boundary-change-notes.html). For population estimates methodology statements, see http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html. "
